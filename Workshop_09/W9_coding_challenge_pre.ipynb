    "\n",
    "You are already familiar with the dataset containing data extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens (raw data available as `BankNote_Authentication.csv` in the `data` directory; more information [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/267/banknote+authentication)). Let's train a decision tree classifier, and pay particular attention to the problem of overfitting by implementing a grid search over the identified effective alphas to determine where predictive performance is maximized. Do the following:\n",
    "- load and inspect the data, then define your feature vector X (we only want to consider the features `variance` and `entropy`) and target Y (the `class`)\n",
    "- perform a train-holdout-test split\n",
    "- train a decision tree without a limit on the maximum depth, then compute the cost complexity pruning path\n",
    "- calculate and plot the training vs. holdout accuracy for each effective alpha\n",
    "- finally, plot the best performing tree and calculate the accuracy on the test set"
