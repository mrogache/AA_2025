    "\n",
    "In the workshop notebook, you learned how to use the keras framework for both classifcation and regression prediction. The classification example we used was for a binary output (cancer cells being benign or malignant). Let's see how we can employ neural networks for multi-class classification. Do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the `../data/iris.csv` dataset and preproccess it as usual.\n",
    "2. Think of an architecture you would employ to enable multi-class classification. You can get some inspiration [here](https://keras.io/guides/sequential_model/).\n",
    "3. Implement a pipeline that consists of the following:\n",
    "    1. train the model on training data\n",
    "    2. evaluate and visualize loss on a training and validation set throughout the fitting of the network\n",
    "4. Use that pipeline to test different architectures / hyperparameters\n",
    "5. Report final performance on the test set\n",
    "6. Think about the model complexity vs. performance tradeoff - is the NN the best overall model?"
