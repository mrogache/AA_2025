    "## Task 1 - Predicting Penguin Species\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's apply our classification skills in a multi-class setting. The Palmer penguins dataset contains information on three penguin species in the islands of the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. More information is available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/690/palmer+penguins-3). When working on this task, keep in mind that this dataset is quite small (n=333 excluding observations missing data). You can load the data via seaborn using `sns.load_dataset(\"penguins\").dropna()`. Train classifiers for the penguin species based on the two features `bill_length_mm` and `flipper_length_mm`. Specifically, evaluate the performance of a logistic regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and SVM classifier with linear kernel, polynomial kernel (3 degrees), and RBF kernel. Report the performance of your selected model."
