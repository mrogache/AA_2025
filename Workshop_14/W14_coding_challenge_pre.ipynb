    "Let's practice text mining using a dataset of movie reviews. Your goal is to compute the sentiment (i.e., if text has a positive or negative connotation) of text documents. We will be using Movie Reviews text data from Rotten Tomatoes (https://www.kaggle.com/c/sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews/data), which can be found in the data-folder (`movies.tsv`).\n",
