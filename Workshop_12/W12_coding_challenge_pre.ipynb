    "Let's apply what we learned about collaborative filtering. We will use the same datasets as in the workshop notebook, i.e. `ratings.csv` and `movies.csv` from https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/. Again, we only want to consider movies with five or more ratings. The user with `userId = 15` has not yet rated the movie named _Beauty and the Beast (1991)_. First, check out some movies the user has rated with the highest score (5). Then, apply and compare item-item and user-user approaches using Pearson correlation and Cosine similarity as similarity measures to predict whether the user will likely enjoy or dislike this movie _Beauty and the Beast (1991)_. Given the users most and least favorite movies, did you expect the predicted rating for _Beauty and the Beast (1991)_?"
